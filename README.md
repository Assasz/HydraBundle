HydraBundle
==============

Hydra is a lightweight vocabulary to create hypermedia-driven Web APIs. By
specifying a number of concepts commonly used in Web APIs it renders the
creation of generic API clients possible.

This is a [Symfony2](http://www.symfony.com/) bundle which shows how easily
Hydra can be integrated in modern Web frameworks. It acts as a proof of
concept to show how Hydra can simplify the implementation of interoperable
and evolvable RESTful APIs.

***WARNING: This is highly experimental stuff that isn't ready for
production use. It is probably also the ugliest code I ever wrote.***

To participate in the development of this specification please file bugs and
issues in the issue tracker.

The code of this bundle is heavily inspired by Sensio's
[SensioGeneratorBundle](https://github.com/sensio/SensioGeneratorBundle) and
Nelmio's [NelmioApiDocBundle](https://github.com/nelmio/NelmioApiDocBundle).
Parts of the source code were copied directly from those two bundles.
